NOTE: Umple crashed every time I tried to create a UML diagram, but this is what I remember from the file had in lab.





	I noticed with the generated code that you cannot gernerate parameters from the UML diagram.
 Also, the methods come with toString methods. From the generated code I could not have parameters,
 because it is based off the UML diagram.
	Compared to my code, the generated code added a lot of extra methods. For example, for my 
getName method from the generated code, since I had it return a String the method automatically 
would return "Hello! My name is" + name. I noticed while creating the UML diagram that the code 
generated from it, when I created a String variable only the variable name showed up in the code.
	The plugin could be useful for when you aren't sure how to implement methods. For me that
has been one of my biggest problems when starting a program. Also, the generated code from Umple
provides the user with a lot of code to start with and work around.
